- HTTP means Hypertext Transfer Protocol.
- It is an Application Layer Protocol.
- Transmits Hypermedia Documents (HTML)
- It follows the Client-Server Model and is a Stateless Protocol ie the server does not keep any data between two requests.
- Often based on TCP/IP to which provides a reliable and stable connection on which HTTP could work. Can also be implemented on UDP which is less reliable and is not common.

## Application Layer Protocol
Abstraction Layer specifying the shared communication protocols and interface methods used by hosts in a communication network.
## Client Server Model
Client opening a connection to make a request and waiting until it recieves a response.
## Stateless Protocol
A communication protocol in which no session information is retained by the reciever which is usually a server. Relevant session data is sent to the reciever by the client such that every packet of data sent can be understood in isolation without context info from the previous sesions.
