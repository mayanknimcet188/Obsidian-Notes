- Array sum queries/ xor queries and prefix sum problems.
- These questions have unique approach. 
- Basically the idea is to reduce the time complexity of the overall problem whenever a fixed number of queries are given using prefix sum concept.
- This approach is very useful escepcially when we have to reduce the time complexity of a problem with given number of queries and we have to perform some fixed operations in each query
